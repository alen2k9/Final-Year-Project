**Server Cluster Energy Management and Carbon Reduction.** 

This project will develop an energy and carbon budgetary system using the Papillon system for a campus wide collection of I.T assets located in different departments, facilities and rooms under the control of several independent authorities. The system will monitor the energy consumption and carbon footprint of serverNames in real-time relative to the allocated budget and indicate if the projected budget is on target or not. Furthermore, to increase productivity, external users to a particular group who have exceeded their budget may be able “buy” spare capacity from those within their budget. In effect, a method of CPU Credits is operating.
